* About DejaDream
This dejadream.com is dedicated to people who are interested and enthusiastic about the world of psychic interpretations and revelations. Nowadays, people are already growing accustomed to the benefits of psychic readings and interventions. Across the globe, you can see millions of people trying to make sense to some of the most pressing questions in their lives through the help of psychics.

Because of this, I did get the idea of putting up a platform where people who seek the help of clairvoyant and extra-gifted individuals can gather. In this site, I have incorporated numerous guides and articles that expound the mysterious of our mundane world. I made sure that all of those who visit this site will be able to find these readings worthwhile. Even if you are skeptical about this particular field, you won’t find the contents strange and utterly foolish. 

All the things that I have put on DejaDream are the results of my daily contemplations and meditation. Day by day, I encounter different things that lead me to various realizations. I always take the time to mull, and through some unseen forces or energies, my mind became receptive to these enigmatic experiences. Specifically, I have the ability to unravel these things. Once I see their real implications, I immediately share them to this site.

- By typing a full comprehensible URL : https://github.com/ (will be automatically converted to a link)
- By making a more Markdown-like link: `Github <https://github.com/>`_ .
